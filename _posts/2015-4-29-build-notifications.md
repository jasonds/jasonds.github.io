## Overview
Tim Chantome and I are in San Francisco this week at Microsoft Build 2015 soaking up the latest and greatest Microsoft has to offer. As part of a three part “Build Notifications” series, here are the key takeaways I gained from our first day.

## Keynote
Satya Nadella opened Build 2015. The central theme for this keynote, reinforced by each speaker, was Microsoft’s focus on empowering developers regardless of platform and form factor, and the support behind a Maker persona, which aligns with our values here at Rightpoint. Here are just a few takeaways:

- Scott Hanselman announced “<a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/code-vs">Visual Studio Code</a>”, the newest member of the Visual Studio Family. This new, free, code editor makes it easy to develop cross-platform, with downloads for Windows, Linux, Mac. It can be downloaded <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">here</a>. Have a look at <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingVisualStudioCodeForWindowsMacAndLinux.aspx">Scott Hanselman’s blog post</a> for more information.
- The most exciting Azure announcement for me was the introduction of Elastic Database Pooling – being able to associate multiple Azure SQL Databases into a single pool, while still maintaining separate isolated databases. Users are able to define strict performance SLAs to dictate pricing. What is particularly cool is that now with a single connection string, you can supply queries to traverse all the databases. I’m curious the implications of this for applications making use of traditional multi-tenant databases. Additionally, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/29/microsoft-introduces-azure-sql-data-warehouse/">Azure SQL data warehouse</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/29/microsoft-announces-azure-data-lake-a-data-repository-for-big-data-analytics/">Azure Data Lake Service</a> were announced; check out the respective posts from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/">Techcrunch</a> for great overviews.
- The new web browser previously titled “Project Spartan” has been officially announced as “Microsoft Edge”.
- HoloLens was reviewed in more depth. All Universal Windows Apps can be placed as holograms. With a tap of a finger, you can pin these holograms to physical surfaces. Using the vocal gesture “Follow me”, holograms can detach from a surface and trail behind the user until he or she decides to pin them to a new surface. A presentation was given by the Cleveland Clinic showing a glimpse into HoloLens applicability to academia.

## Maximize Your Coding Productivity for Apps, Devices, and Services with Visual Studio 2015

## A Lap Around .NET 2015
- The road ahead for .NET focuses around three pillars:

    - Announced at Build 2014, the .NET Foundation is a community to foster open source development and discussion around the .NET framework.

Looking forward to tomorrow!
